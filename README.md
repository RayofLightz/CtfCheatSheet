# Ctf Cheat Sheet
This is a simple ctf cheat sheet that I wrote awhile back for my ctf team to use.
It is too small for a blog post and because of that (and several other reasons) I am releasing it as self contained repo
and with a make file to create an ebook.

## Build the ebook
Its as simple as 
`make epub`
